ComplexSubSystem - Is the sub-system that we create Facade for it. 
The sub-system contains a lot of object with init step, configurations and extra data.
We not need all sub-system only a part of it in example only Encode method for file.
So we create Facade that responsible for init object and communications with sub-system.
